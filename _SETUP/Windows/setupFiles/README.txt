SINE Isochronic Entrainer v1.8.5

License: GNU GPLv3

Usage: to run the player, double click SINE.jar; to run the editor, double click SINE-Editor.jar . If the application doesn't start, make sure you have Java 7 or newer installed (free download at http://www.java.com/). 
If you're running Microsoft Windows, I recommend you use the automatic installer instead of this manual install.

Don't forget to download some presets!
